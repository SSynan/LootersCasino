# LootersCasino

This is really just a toy project so I can learn some Python syntax. During this writing (near the initial push) the game is not
actually functional and is still in development. There are a ton of assumptions made in the code and some design decisions 
could probably use some rework, there is no real exception handling, no real logging mechanism, etc but that is straying from the
point of this project. 

This project may grow a little bit to include various simple card and perhaps other casino games or even other non-casino 
gambling games such as street craps, but will likely not see a "real production" state as by the time I have enough Python under
my belt to produce such a thing, I'll likely have moved on to a more interesting project.
